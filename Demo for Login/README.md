# Registration and login routine for a website

Task is to build a simple registration and login routine for a website.

it is possible to register as a user on the website.
the user is able to login to the website.
Details:
create a small backend with a simple user management system using node.js.

the registration process should be a double opt-in process. That is…
the user makes the registration
he then sees the message “We sent you an email with a link to complete your registration.”
an automated email is sent to him with the link.
After he clicked the link he can login (not before he clicked the link!).
check your code in on GitHub.
deploy everything on a server.
